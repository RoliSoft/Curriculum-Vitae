# Curriculum Vitæ

This repository contains my personal CV in L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X. It is rather long, clocking in at around 8 pages. Whether this is unacceptably long or not, it should be noted that traditionally the *short version* you might be looking for is called a *résumé*, while the *curriculum vitæ* is an in-depth document of one's skills/experiences/achievements.

Previously this repository had a hand-crafted CV and a résumé based on ModernCV. The contents of the two have been merged into one since I did not see much point in maintaining both.

A rendered version is available in the [cv.pdf](cv.pdf) file.
