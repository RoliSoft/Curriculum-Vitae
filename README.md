# Curriculum Vitæ

This repository contains my personal CV in L<sub>a</sub>T<sup>e</sup>X. It is rather long, clocking in at around 12 pages. Whether this is unacceptably long or not, it should be noted that traditionally the "short version" you might be looking for is called a *résumé*, while the *curriculum vitæ* is an in-depth document of one's skills/experiences/achievements, hence the number of pages.
