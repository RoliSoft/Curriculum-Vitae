\section{Notable Personal Projects}

	\subsection{Windows Subsystem for Linux Distribution Switcher}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Project born out of sheer curiosity once WSL was announced, on whether I could swap the distribution shipped with the earliest version of WSL with something else, and then make a generic solution.

		\item A simple-to-use \textbf{Python} script was developed after I found a way, which was the first of its kind, and could swap in any distribution from an \textbf{ISO}, \textbf{rootfs tarball} or nearly any image on the \textbf{Docker Hub}.

		\item The repository has \textbf{1,300 stars} and 120 forks, as of August 2018. It has been featured in several tutorial sites, including \textbf{kali.org}'s initial way to get \textbf{Kali Linux in WSL} before the app store package, and \textbf{acknowledged by Microsoft} as a "cool community project": \httplink[https://goo.gl/GkVkAm]{www.kali.org/tutorials/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Host Scanner}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item An \textbf{open-source} application developed as an implementation companion to my bachelor's thesis. The purpose of the application is to perform \textbf{autonomous vulnerability assessment} using both active and passive scanning, or by analyzing earlier reports of 3$^{rd}$-party tools.

		\item The features and implementation techniques are unique to this application, a fact which was validated by an \textbf{award-winning} presentation at the \textbf{XV. Scientific Students' Associations Conference}.

		\item Project highlighted by several tutorial and new sites, including one of the supported data providers, \textbf{Mr. Looquer}, as a creative way to use their data.

		\item The application was developed in \textbf{C++} with strong \textbf{cross-platform} support with OS-specific implementations for \textit{Linux}, \textit{Windows} and \textit{BSD/Darwin} systems. The various helper scripts that come bundled with the application were developed in \textbf{Go}.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{RS TV Show Tracker}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item An \textbf{open-source} application which was born out of the need for the features it offered, as there were no alternative solutions for them at the time. To date, no software has so many features in this category, and as a result, under the four years it's been actively developed, its popularity has grown exponentially. For years, I single-handedly maintained it and pushed updates to hundreds of thousands of users on a monthly basis.

		\item The application was developed in \textbf{C\#} with an interface in \textbf{WPF}, and was kept constantly up-to-date with the newer technologies that have been released during its development phase.

		\item There are, as of May 2015, \textbf{135,700 active daily users} of the application, with the number of installations reaching into the \textbf{millions}. Development started in \textbf{February 2010} and halted in \textbf{January 2016} due to shifting priorities and avoidance of potential legal issues.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{BrightAlien Projects}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Full-stack development} of the project websites and continued maintenance, including initial \textbf{devops responsibilities} (such as cloud server deployment on DigitalOcean) and continued \textbf{proactive monitoring} and administration of the web, database and load-balancer servers.

		\item The websites were developed in \textbf{PHP} (\textbf{HHVM}) backed by \textbf{MySQL} servers in \textbf{multi-master replication} configuration and \textbf{ElasticSearch} instances for the search feature.

		\item At their peak, the sites had \textbf{15 million unique users} individually, whom were served by 4 geo-located and load-balanced front-end servers, attaining \textbf{100\% uptime} and \textbf{under 10 millisecond response times} for all users throughout peak times. Development started in \textbf{December 2013} and halted in \textbf{January 2016} due to shifting priorities to graduation.

\section{Interests}

	\textbf{Self-teaching} is an important part of my lifestyle, I constantly \textbf{try out new languages}, \textbf{new technologies}, \textbf{new practices}, then go back and \textbf{re-do old projects}, with a twist, and I challenge myself to do it much better this time, by setting much higher goals.

\section{Early Personal Development}

	First exposure to the world of programming via PHP at the age of \textbf{11} followed by publishing the first dynamic webpage at the age of \textbf{12}. Published first \textbf{desktop application}, at the age of \textbf{13}, which utilized \textbf{databases}, \textbf{regular expressions}, \textbf{networking} and \textbf{screen-scraping}. Application was published to \textbf{Softpedia}, where it was accepted and reviewed by their staff, leading to a few hundred downloads during its lifetime. Received first income from \textbf{Google AdSense} at the age of \textbf{14}. Used \textbf{neural networks}, in order to train a software to \textbf{recognize} numbers and letters that appear on a webcam-provided image in \textbf{real-time}, at the age of \textbf{16}. Developed first \textbf{autonomous web-service} that relied on user-contributed data at the age of \textbf{17}, a \textbf{recommendation system}, which provides \textbf{tailored recommendations} based on a user's preference list.
