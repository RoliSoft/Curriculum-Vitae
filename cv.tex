\section{Personal Skills}
	\textbf{Communication skills} gained through regular business and social interaction with clients and fellow developers. \textbf{Presentation skills} acquired by frequently giving presentations about various topics to varying audiences. \textbf{Organizational}/\textbf{Managerial skills} accumulated over time via superfluous scheduling and prioritizing to meet business and educational deadlines.

\section{Interests}
	\textbf{Self-teaching} is an important part of my lifestyle. I try to keep up with the ever-evolving technologies of today. I constantly \textbf{try out new languages}, \textbf{new technologies} and \textbf{new practices}. I constantly go back and \textbf{re-do old projects}, with a twist, and I challenge myself to do it much better this time, by setting much higher goals. I read \textbf{research papers}, \textbf{0-day bulletins} and other sources of information that let me be ahead of the competition. I am not afraid to take initiative, and to color outside of the lines. I don't mind to get my hands dirty to try something out, let it be DoS-ing my own server in order to try out if an optimization technique or security practice did indeed work. I also watch \textbf{conference videos} (such as \textbf{DefCon}, \textbf{Black Hat}, etc) and \textbf{tech-talks} (such as \textbf{Microsoft's GoingNative}, and much more) in order to get an edge in their specific fields.

\section{Personal Projects}
	\subsection{RS TV Show Tracker}

		An \textbf{open-source} application which was born out of the need for the features it currently offers, as there were no alternative solutions for them at the time. To date, no software has so many features in this category, and as a result, under the four years it's been actively developed, its popularity has grown exponentially. Today, I single-handedly maintain it and push updates to hundreds of thousands of users on a monthly basis.
		
		The application was developed in \textbf{C\#} with an interface in \textbf{WPF}, and was kept constantly up-to-date with the newer technologies that have been released during its development phase.

		There are, as of writing this in May 2015, \textbf{135,700 active daily users} of the application, with the number of installations reaching into the \textbf{millions}. Development started in \textbf{February 2010}.

	\subsection{AlienSubtitles.com}

		\textbf{Full-stack development} of the website and continued maintenance, including initial \textbf{devops responsibilities} (such as cloud server deployment on DigitalOcean) and continued \textbf{proactive monitoring} and administration of the web, database and load-balancer servers.

		The website was developed in \textbf{PHP} (\textbf{HHVM}) backed by \textbf{MySQL} servers in \textbf{multi-master replication} configuration and \textbf{ElasticSearch} instances for the search feature.

		At its peak, the site had \textbf{15 million unique users}, who were served by 4 geo-located and load-balanced front-end servers, attaining \textbf{100\% uptime} and \textbf{under 10 millisecond response times} for all users throughout peak times. Development started in \textbf{December 2013}.
