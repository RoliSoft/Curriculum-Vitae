\section{Interests}
	\textbf{Self-teaching} is an important part of my lifestyle. I try to keep up with the ever-evolving technologies of today. I constantly \textbf{try out new languages}, \textbf{new technologies} and \textbf{new practices}. I constantly go back and \textbf{re-do old projects}, with a twist, and I challenge myself to do it much better this time, by setting much higher goals. I read \textbf{research papers}, \textbf{0-day bulletins} and other sources of information that let me be ahead of the competition. I am not afraid to take initiative, and to color outside of the lines. I don't mind to get my hands dirty to try something out, let it be DoS-ing my own server in order to try out if an optimization technique or security practice did indeed work. I also watch \textbf{conference videos} (such as \textbf{DefCon}, \textbf{Black Hat}, etc) and \textbf{tech-talks} (such as \textbf{Microsoft's GoingNative}, and much more) in order to get an edge in their specific fields.
